      <p>
        Village Roots Collective embraces the philosophy that it takes a village not just to raise a child, but to
        nurture a family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to foster a supportive community through cooperative early childhood education, homeschooling
        support, and enriching social opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>We are dedicated to cultivating an inclusive environment where every family thrives together.</p>
