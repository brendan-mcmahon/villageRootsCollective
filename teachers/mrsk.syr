        <img src="../assets/Mrs-K-3.png" alt="pic 1" /> Hello and Welcome to Village Roots Collective! I’m so happy
        you’re here! My name is Krystall DeBoy, but you can call me Mrs. K, and I will be your teacher this year. A
        little about myself… I live in Hendricks County with my amazing husband Joe and our 2 beautiful children, Isaac
        and Addison. We also share our home with our 2 cats, Max and Lucky. In my free time I love to ground myself with
        the Earth. Nature is my happy and healing place☺ I’m excited for what’s to come and I look forward to getting to
        know you and your child this year!

        I started in the co-op world in 2013 as a parent/stay at home mom with my son. I joined the board as
        Co-President and held that position until May 2016, when both of my kids went to public school full time. In
        November 2016, I accepted a position in my children's school district working in Special Education with children
        of all abilities until May 2018. In August of 2018 I became a co-op teacher and have been teaching ever since.
