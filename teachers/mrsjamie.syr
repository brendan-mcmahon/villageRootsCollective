    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <article>
      <img src="../assets/Mrs-K-3.png" alt="pic 1" /> My name is Jamie McMahon. I am the Chief Executive Officer and
      Executive Director of Village Roots Collective. That makes me sound really fancy and mature, but those who know me
      well can tell you that, most of the time, I have more in common with our 5-year-old students than I do other
      adults. The greatest joy of this work is being invited into a child's world of imagination, curitosity,
      creativity, and fun. I am passionate about providing an environment in which kids are free to be their most
      authentic selves, where they will be celebrated for their uniqueness and met with respect, admiration, and
      encouragement. Children are whole humans, not smaller adults. At Village Roots, we focus on caring for who our
      students are today, without adding pressure of expectation of who they will be tomorrow.

      I enjoy spending time with my husband, Brendan, and two kiddos, Addie & Walter. My hobbies include all things arts
      & crafts, listening to true crime podcasts, and board games. My idea of a perfect night is sipping on a fresh
      glass of iced tea as I watch a good movie under the stars from my cozy hammock.
