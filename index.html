      <p>
        Village Roots Collective embraces the philosophy that it takes a village
        not just to raise a child, but to nurture a family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to foster a supportive community through cooperative
        early childhood education, homeschooling support, and enriching social
        opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are dedicated to cultivating an inclusive environment where every
        family thrives together.
